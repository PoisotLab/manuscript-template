  "description": "This template is used by the Poisot lab at Université de Montréal to write manuscripts using github. It uses github actions as a way to generate a website that can be annotated using hypothes.is, a PDF document for copy-editing and submission to journals, and a PDF document for submission to preprint servers. At every push on the master branch, the whole series of documents will get built.",
