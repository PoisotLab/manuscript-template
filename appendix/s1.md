# Using supplementary materials

Supp. mat. are rendered from the `appendix/` folder. They are written as `.md`
files, and rendered as PDFs. Note that there is a single template for Supp. Mat.

The supp. mat. file must have two elements in its front-matter:

~~~ yaml
---
order: 1
name: Illustration of supplementary materials
---
~~~

The rest of the document can contain whatever you want, including references,
which are rendered indepently, like for example this reference to
@Fahrenholz1913EctUnd.

In order to "register" the Supp. Mat. file, you need to add it to the `metadata.json` file, specifically:

~~~ json
"appendix": [
        {"file": "s1", "shortname": "Supp. Mat. example"}
]
~~~

Note that the first field is the *file* where the supp. mat. is without the
extension, and the second field is the short name of the supp. mat. -- this is
used to render a list of supp. mat. at the beginning of each one.
