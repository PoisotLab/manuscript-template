# Metadata overview

The `metadata.json` file, at the root of the project, is where all of the
information that are not text are stored. Ths includes the manuscript title,
affiliations, the abstract and keywords, and the citation style.

**Note that** the license is, by default, CC-BY 4.0. This is hardcoded in the
template. There are no plans to support other CC licenses for now.

# Manuscript metadata

The `title` field (a single string of text) stores the full manuscript title.
The `keywords` array is a list of strings, which represents the keywords
associated to the manuscript.
